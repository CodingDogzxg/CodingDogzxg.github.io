              I listened the love story of my parents. Love was love in the past. Their romance faded along the way into daily trifles.
              I heard that we'll stay at home for another 2 months. In this case, stay at home and enjoy the spring. I can get in touch with ZhengZheng soon.

              Rebulid V2ray using Japan node today. Speed is as slow as past.
              Although v2ray+ws+TLS+DNSSEC can pretend all the requests as normal ones, the burden of encripting and decripting is on Router.
              Telecom sets a limit on outing network. For this we can use CN2 GT or CN2 GIA to solve that problem.

              Due to the pandemic, the speed of our vps's slow like a dead turtle. All my SSRs are dead. Bought a foreign web and built a V2ray. The speed is still slow.
